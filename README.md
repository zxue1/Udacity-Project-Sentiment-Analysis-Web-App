# Udacity-Project-Sentiment-Analysis-Web-App
In this project, a recurrent neural network (RNN, LSTM) model was developed for determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. The model was built, trained and deployed by using PyTorch and AWS SageMaker service with word embedding as input features. In addition, a simple web application was constructed to interact with the deployed model.
